Use this repo with nix to easily create a shell containing GHC, `cabal` and related
tools (so far, just `cabal2nix`) easily.

# Usage

Assuming this repo is hosted at https://github.com/m4dc4p/haskell-shell, you can use the flake as follows

## GHC 9.2
`nix develop m4dc4p/haskell-shell#ghc92`

## GHC 9.4
`nix develop m4dc4p/haskell-shell#ghc94`

Or, as 9.4 is the default:

`nix develop m4dc4p/haskell-shell`


## GHC 9.6
`nix develop m4dc4p/haskell-shell#ghc96`
